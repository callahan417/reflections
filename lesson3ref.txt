When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Use a remote repository when multiple contributors are working on the same project.  A remote repository may also be useful for a single contributor when working from different offices or devices at various times.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
An automatic pull could interfere with current operations on the local repository, especially if you are in the middle of editing files, adding files to the staging area, or creating commits.
